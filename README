This neo.SlackBuild is not exaclty in the Slackway way for building. But its the only KISS and stable way to follow releases of neo, for me... 

NOTE:
Neo packages for ubuntu were built with custom flags NEO_ENABLE_i915_PRELIM_DETECTION=1
CHANGED custom flag NEO_ENABLE_XE_DRM_DETECTION was not set
binaries (deb,ddeb)posted with this release are not compatible with Xe DRM. 

CONFIGURATION FLAGS:

REQUIRES:
