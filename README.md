# neo.SlackBuild

Intel(R) Graphics Compute Runtime for oneAPI Level Zero and OpenCL(TM) Driver for Slackware-current


## What is neo?
[NEO](https://github.com/intel/compute-runtime) is the shorthand name for Compute Runtime contained within this repository. It is also a development mindset that we adopted when we first started the implementation effort for OpenCL.

The project evolved beyond a single API and NEO no longer implies a specific API. When talking about a specific API, we will mention it by name (e.g. Level Zero, OpenCL).
